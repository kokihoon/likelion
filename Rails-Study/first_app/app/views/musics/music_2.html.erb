<p>Times that I've seen you lose your way
  You're not in control and you won't be told
  All I can do to keep you safe is hold you close
  Hold you close till you can breathe on your own
  Till you can breathe on your own
  Hold tight you're slowly coming back to life
  I'll be keeping your head up
  I'll be keeping your head up, darling
  Let go of all your haunted dreams tonight
  I'll be keeping your head up
  I'll be keeping your head up, darling
  Hold tight you're slowly coming back to life
  I'll be keeping your head up
  I'll be keeping your head up, darling
  Let go of all your haunted dreams tonight
  I'll be keeping your head up
  I'll be keeping your head up
  And I won't let you down
  Everyone keeps a darker place
  To lose control, you're not alone
  And when you come looking for embrace
  I know your soul, I'll be your home
  Til you can breathe on your own
  Til you can breathe on your own
  Hold tight, you're slowly coming back to life
  I'll be keeping your head up
  I'll be keeping your head up, darling
  Let go of all your haunted dreams tonight
  I'll be keeping your head up
  I'll be keeping your head up, darling
  Hold tight, you're slowly coming back to life
  I'll be keeping your head up
  I'll be keeping your head up, darling
  Let go of all your haunted dreams tonight
  I'll be keeping your head up
  I'll be keeping your head up
  And I won't let you down
  You never think that you can fly
  You'll always swim against the tide
  Don't you know your pain is mine?
  And I would die a thousand times to ease your mind
  To ease your mind
  Hold tight, you're slowly coming back to life
  I'll be keeping your head up
  I'll be keeping your head up, darling
  Let go of all your haunted dreams tonight
  I'll be keeping your head up
  I'll be keeping your head up, darling
  Hold tight, you're slowly coming back to life
  I'll be keeping your head up
  I'll be keeping your head up, darling
  Let go of all your haunted dreams tonight
  I'll be keeping your head up
  I'll be keeping your head up
  And I won't let you down</p>
